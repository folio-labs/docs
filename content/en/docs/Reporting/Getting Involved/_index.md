The FOLIO Reporting community welcomes all new members, and there are several different ways people can participate. The FOLIO Reporting Special Interest Group (or SIG) coordinates activities related to FOLIO reporting with the LDP. In addition to contributing to the SIGâ€™s reporting work, members have the opportunity to grow their data analytics skills and gain an in-depth understanding of the FOLIO reporting infrastructure and tools.

One of the main objectives of the Reporting SIG is to develop [folio-analytics](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics/tree/release-1.0), a central repository of FOLIO report query templates that participating institutions can download and adapt for their reporting needs. To join the Reporting SIG, feel free to attend any of our public meetings by reviewing the details on our [Reporting SIG wiki](https://wiki.folio.org/display/RPT/Reporting+SIG+Meetings+and+Notes).

Reporting SIG members can choose from three main roles on one or more of our report development teams:

* **Query writer**: write SQL report templates from report requirements documented by the community and contribute them to [folio-analytics](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-analytics/tree/release-1.0).
* **Reviewer**: test new reports and share your findings with query writers.
* **Subject matter expert**: use your functional area expertise (e.g., circulation) to help query writers understand data and workflows.
