FOLIO is built differently from the other library service platforms.
From the beginning, librarians and technologists working in libraries were an active participant in shaping how FOLIO would be developed.
As FOLIO is deployed in libraries worldwide, developers from libraries and service providers are invited to extend apps and contribute talent to the effort to build commonly needed features.
For more information about developing FOLIO, see [https://dev.folio.org/](https://dev.folio.org/).
